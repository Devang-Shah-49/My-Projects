# About
This Repository contains various completed tasks assigned as part of DJ-Unicode Interviews
# Navigation
- I have created a main folder for each category (Example: Front-end, Back-end, etc.)
- Inside these folders, I have included sub-folders for each task (Example: Task 1, Task 2, etc.)
- On opening the sub-folders, you can view the files which contain the work performed by me on that task (index.html, css, etc.)
